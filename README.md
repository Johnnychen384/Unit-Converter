# Unit-Converter

A part of the Scrimba lessons to learn js. This is a solo project, we were given the requirements and a picture example of what it should look like. Based on the picture and using html and css i tried my best to rebuild it. Further more by using basic javascript i managed to add functions that convert from one unit to a whole different unit.
